I’m **Daiyaan Matthews**, curious about how technology and systems work, and exploring ways to learn, create, and grow along the way. Online, I go by **Damon Sharkovsky**, where I document my learning journey and experiments through my personal blog and portfolio (“IV”), sharing insights, small projects, and reflections on technology and personal growth.

I’m not chasing certifications or pretending to be an expert, I focus on authentic learning and hands on experience. I enjoy tackling challenges, understanding systems deeply, and sharing what I discover along the way.

## Current Focus

- Maintaining a personal blog using Jekyll for technical writing and portfolio showcase  
- Experimenting with Linux environments and scripting
- Web Development (HTML, CSS, JS)

## Future Goals

- Exploring cybersecurity fundamentals and ethical hacking
- Deepening understanding of hardware and computer systems 


I aim to build a body of work that reflects genuine curiosity, technical skill, and a mindset of continuous improvement.
