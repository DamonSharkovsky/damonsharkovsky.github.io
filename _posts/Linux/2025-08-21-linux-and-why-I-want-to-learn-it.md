I’m relatively new to Linux, having mostly used Windows, so the transition was challenging. However, I’m motivated to learn Linux because it’s foundational to computing, cybersecurity, and software development. Its efficiency, speed, and minimal bloat make it a powerful platform for experimentation and problem-solving.


## Goals of Learning Linux


### Short-Term Goals
- Understand essential Linux commands and file system navigation
- Practice scripting and automation to solve real problems
- Experiment safely with Linux environments


### Long-Term Goals
- Develop deep scripting skills to automate tasks efficiently
- Gain hands on experience in cybersecurity and system administration
- Transition to Arch Linux for a minimalist, hands on Linux environment

## Learning Environments
I currently use **Linux Mint** for a user-friendly introduction to Linux and **Pop!_OS** at my learning place, both Ubuntu based distributions. These environments allowed me to practice essential commands, scripting, and system navigation. My long-term goal is to move to **Arch Linux**, a minimalist distribution that requires hands-on configuration and deeper understanding of Linux internals. This transition will help solidify my skills and deepen my mastery of the system.

## Projects and Experiments


### Automating Firefox with a Script
As a beginner, I used AI to help me create a small script that automates opening Firefox and navigating to a webpage. This exercise taught me:
- How to interact with processes in Linux
- Basics of Bash scripting and debugging


```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Automate Firefox
nohup firefox --no-remote -P Work >/dev/null 2>&1 &
```


Even though I relied on AI assistance, this project reinforced the value of scripting and showed how automation can save time for repetitive tasks. It also gave me hands on experience with writing and understanding Bash commands.

## Next Steps
- Explore shell scripting in depth
- Learn system administration commands
- Practice networking and file system management
- Document experiments and scripts on this site to track progress


Learning Linux is about more than commands; it’s about developing a mindset for experimentation, troubleshooting, and independent problem-solving. This site will document my journey, the challenges I face, and the lessons I learn along the way.
