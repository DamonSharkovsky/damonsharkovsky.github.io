During the BabesGotBytes hackathon, our team developed the idea for **SafeGuard Community**, a platform to help users identify, report, and protect themselves from AI-driven scams and cybersecurity threats. The project focuses on practical tools and community-driven resources to improve digital safety.

## Inspiration

The concept for SafeGuard Community was inspired by apps and platforms that successfully use community-driven reporting and real-time notifications:

- **EskomSePush (ESP):** Demonstrates effective real-time alerts for critical events and a community-driven feed where users can see updates, trending issues, and collective reporting.  
- **Reddit:** Shows how community reporting and discussion can surface relevant information quickly.  

We combined these ideas to design a platform that empowers users to report scams, share knowledge, and receive actionable guidance in a centralized, accessible interface.

## Project Concept

SafeGuard Community is designed around six core components:

- **Community Reporting:** Users can submit scam experiences, ask questions, and contribute to the community knowledge base.  
- **Reports Feed:** A live feed showing the latest reports, trending scams, and important updates to keep the community informed.  
- **Resources:** Curated, age-appropriate learning modules and official cybersecurity guides, designed to help users of all levels understand and protect themselves online.  
- **Q&A Assistant:** An AI-powered assistant trained specifically on cybersecurity topics, designed to help users understand threats, answer questions, and provide guidance on staying safe online.
- **User Accounts:** Login and signup functionality for personalized participation.  
- **Modern UI:** Responsive and organized interface for improved accessibility.  

The platformâ€™s goal is to make cybersecurity awareness actionable and user-friendly, enabling communities to share information, track emerging threats, and protect themselves from evolving online risks.
